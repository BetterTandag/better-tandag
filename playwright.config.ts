 * including an unrelated project — `next dev` quietly moved to the next free
 * port and Playwright went on waiting for 3000 until it timed out two minutes
 * later, reporting a `webServer` failure and nothing about the actual cause.
 * Setting `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` to a free port did not help either: the server
 * still started on 3000 and the wait still watched the other one.
 *
 * Derived rather than duplicated, so the server that starts and the URL under
 * test cannot disagree.

     *    what this looks like;
     *  - a STALE `next dev` from an earlier session — the suite passes, against
     *    code that is no longer what you just wrote. That one is the dangerous
     *    half, because it is green.
     *
     * If a run looks inexplicable, kill the dev server and run it again, or set
     * PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL to a port nothing else is using — which now moves the
     * server too, per the note on PORT above.
