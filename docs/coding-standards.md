## Runtime & language

- **Node 24** (`.nvmrc`), **npm** (lockfile `package-lock.json`).
- **TypeScript strict.** No `any` — use `unknown` and narrow, or a precise type. Types for every content shape,
  config object, and component prop.
- Prefer `satisfies` over type assertions. Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- **Path alias `@/*` → `./src/*`.** Use it for cross-directory imports; relative paths within a folder.
- **Validate at the boundary with Zod.** Anything parsed from YAML, markdown front-matter, JSON config, a route
  param, or an external API is `unknown` until a schema has proven otherwise. `z.infer` the resulting type
  rather than hand-writing a duplicate interface.

## Rendering — the single most important rule

- **React Server Components by default.** A component is a Server Component unless it declares `'use client'`.
- **`'use client'` only at the interactive leaf** that genuinely needs `useState`/`useEffect`/`useRef`, an
  event handler, a browser API, or a client-only library. Never on a `page.tsx` or `layout.tsx` "to make a
  child work" — that pulls the whole subtree into the bundle. (`error.tsx` is the one exception: Next requires
  error boundaries to be Client Components.)
- **Push the boundary down, pass data in.** Read on the server, pass plain serialisable props into the leaf. A
  Client Component may render server-rendered `children` passed through as props.
- Don't fetch on the client what the server could have rendered. `useEffect` + `fetch` on mount costs a round
  trip, a loading state, and the accessibility and SEO of real HTML.
- Use `<Suspense>` to stream a slow segment rather than blocking the page; `loading.tsx` for route-level
  fallbacks.
- Server Components can't use hooks, context, or event handlers; Client Components can't be `async` or read the
  filesystem. If you are fighting that, the boundary is in the wrong place.

## App Router conventions

- Routes are **folders** under `src/app/[locale]/`. File conventions: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`,
  `error.tsx` (Client Component), `not-found.tsx`, `template.tsx`, `route.ts`. Route folders are kebab-case and
  match the URL segment.
- **No Pages Router, no `getServerSideProps`/`getStaticProps`, no `next/head`, no `react-helmet`, no React
  Router.**
- **Request APIs are async.** `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()`, `headers()`, and `draftMode()` return
  Promises — always `await`.
- **Use the generated route types**, not hand-written prop interfaces:

  ```tsx
  export default async function ServicePage({
    params,
  }: PageProps<'/[locale]/services/[category]/[slug]'>) {
    const { locale, category, slug } = await params;
  }
  ```

  `PageProps` / `LayoutProps` / `RouteContext` are global; `npm run typegen` regenerates them after a route
  change.

- **Dynamic routes enumerate their pages** with `generateStaticParams`, sourced from the content manifests — so
  a new markdown page is prerendered with no code change.
- **A missing page calls `notFound()`.** Never render a "not found" message inside a 200 response.
- Every segment that can fail gets an `error.tsx` boundary. Keep it small and recoverable (`reset()`).
- Navigate with `next/link`; `useRouter` from `next/navigation`, never `next/router`.

## Caching & data loading

`next.config.ts` sets **`cacheComponents: true`** — nothing is cached implicitly.

- **Opt in with `'use cache'`** at the top of an async function, then declare lifetime and invalidation with
  `cacheLife()` / `cacheTag()` from `next/cache`.
- **Invalidate with `revalidateTag()`**, not by guessing a TTL.
- **Never use `unstable_cache`** — superseded by `'use cache'`.
- **Content reads should be cached.** `src/lib/content.ts` reads files that only change on deploy.
  ⚠️ **In development that cache does not notice a YAML edit** — `content/` is read at runtime, so it is not a
  module the bundler watches, and `cacheLife('max')` never expires. Restart `npm run dev` after a content
  change. Nothing calls `revalidateTag('home-content')`; the tag exists for a future editing surface.
- **Live upstreams must be time-boxed** with `AbortSignal.timeout(...)` and a short `cacheLife`, and must
  **degrade to an empty state rather than throwing**. A third-party outage is not a page outage.
- Route Handlers under `src/app/api/` exist only for what a Server Component genuinely can't do. Don't create
  an internal API route to read `content/` — call the loader directly.

### Calling something outside this repository

Almost nothing does. `content/` is files and `config/` is a file, so for most of a portal's life `src/`
contains **no `fetch` at all**. That makes the first external call the pattern every later one copies,
and it is worth getting right once — BetterTago's is `src/lib/weather.ts`, written to be read as one.

```ts
export async function getThing(): Promise<Thing | null> {
  'use cache';
  cacheLife('thing'); // a NAMED profile, declared in next.config.ts
  cacheTag('thing');

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(8000) });
    if (!response.ok) return null;

    const parsed = schema.safeParse(await response.json());
    return parsed.success ? shape(parsed.data) : null;
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
}
```

Six rules, and every one of them has a specific production failure behind it:

1. **Time-box every request** with `AbortSignal.timeout`, and **pick the bound from a measurement, not
   a feeling.** A cold Node `fetch` pays DNS and a TLS handshake that a warm one and a `curl` do not —
   2.5s looked generous, sat on top of the cold-start distribution, and made a widget that never once
   rendered while the upstream was perfectly healthy.
2. **Validate at the boundary** with Zod. The body is `unknown` until a schema says otherwise, and **a
   200 with the wrong shape is a failure, not data** — the case a `response.ok` check misses, and the
   one that puts `undefined` on a civic page.
3. **Return `null`, never throw.** A DNS error, an abort and a schema mismatch are the same event to a
   reader: there is nothing to show. **A third-party outage is not a page outage.**
4. **Opt into the cache, and check WHERE the caller renders.** Under `cacheComponents` nothing is
   cached implicitly, so an uncached read inside a layout is uncached data in `<html><body>` on every
   route with no `<Suspense>` around it — which the build refuses to prerender. Give the profile an
   `expire` too, so a dead upstream cannot leave a stale value looking current.
5. **Split the module.** `'use cache'` only resolves inside the Next runtime, so a function carrying it
   cannot be unit-tested. Keep an uncached half holding everything that can fail, and a thin cached
   wrapper components call.
6. **Never let CI contact the upstream** — and note that `page.route()` does **not** stub a server-side
   fetch. Playwright intercepts the browser; a loader running on the server will quietly hit the real
   API and pass or fail on whether it happened to be up. Mock at the `fetch` boundary in units.

Two more that are not about resilience:

- **Qualify upstream timestamps before storing or parsing them.** A naive `"2026-08-21T00:30"` is
  parsed against the _runtime's_ zone, so it means one instant on a developer machine and another on a
  UTC server. Append the offset the payload gives you, and pin the test suite's `TZ`.
- **If what you render carries authority a reader might act on** — weather, hazard, health, a fee —
  say where it came from, when, and what it is not, inline and beside the value.

## Content pipeline

- **`content/` is the data layer, and `src/lib/content.ts` is the only module that reads it.** No component,
  page, or route handler touches `node:fs`.
- Category folders hold an **`index.yaml`** manifest plus one markdown file per page. **The YAML `slug` must
  match the markdown filename exactly** — otherwise the page 404s while the file sits there looking correct.
- Parse YAML with `js-yaml` and validate with Zod before it leaves the loader. Malformed content is a
  build-time error, not a runtime surprise.
- Markdown renders through `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` with an explicit component override map. **No
  `rehype-raw`, no raw-HTML passthrough**, never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on content.
- **Adding a page must require no code change.** If it does, the route is wrong — fix the route.

### 🙅 No named people outside the data layer

**A person's name is DATA. It never goes into prose.**

Do not write the name of any person — an elected official, a department head, a barangay captain, a
contributor, a resident — into a document, a code comment, a commit message, a test fixture, or placeholder
copy. **Refer to the role**: "the Mayor", "the Vice Mayor", "the City DRRM officer", "a maintainer", "a
resident contributor".

The **only** places a name may live are `content/**` and `config/lgu.config.json`, where it sits beside its
source and its check date, is rendered rather than asserted, and can be corrected by anyone with a content
change after an election.

Why it is a rule rather than a preference: an official's name written into a design note is an unsourced
political claim with no citation, no date, and no obvious place to fix it. The same name in `content/` carries
all three. Naming **organisations** (City DRRM Office, PNP Tandag, PSA, BetterGov.ph) is fine, as is a
historical figure that reaches the page through a cited record in `content/`.

## Internationalisation

- **`next-intl`** with an `[locale]` segment and **`proxy.ts`** for negotiation. Next 16 renamed
  `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`; don't create one. With a `src/` directory present it must live at
  `src/proxy.ts` — at the repo root it compiles to an empty middleware manifest and `/` 404s.
- **Two mechanisms, kept strictly apart:** UI chrome and labels → `messages/{en,fil}.json`; page body copy →
  markdown, with `<slug>.fil.md` beside `<slug>.md`.
- **No hardcoded user-facing strings in components.**
- **Missing FIL falls back to English with a visible banner.** Deliberate, and never silent. A key sitting in
  `fil.json` with an English value defeats it — the guardrails test carries a reviewed exemption list for the
  handful of loanwords and proper nouns that are legitimately identical.
- Locale-aware date and number formatting goes through `next-intl`'s formatters.

## Styling & design system

- **Tailwind CSS v4, configured in CSS** — `@import 'tailwindcss'` plus `@theme` in `src/app/globals.css`.
  ⚠️ **Never create `tailwind.config.ts` or `tailwind.config.js`** — those are v3, v4 ignores them silently, and
  a theme "change" that lands in one is a change that never happened. No JavaScript-based config.
- **Named tokens only.** `bg-primary-700`, `text-ink-secondary`, `gap-4`. **Hardcoded hex/rgb/hsl and arbitrary
  values (`bg-[#16643c]`, `text-[13px]`) fail the build** — `src/lib/guardrails.test.ts` scans for them. A
  colour with no token means the ramp is incomplete: extend `@theme`, don't inline a hex.
- **Two token layers.** Raw ramps (`primary`, `accent`, `neutral`, …) live in `@theme` and never change with
  the theme. Semantic **roles** (`--surface-page`, `--ink`, `--line`, `--mark-land`, `--ink-wordmark`) are
  declared on `:root`, `[data-theme='dark']` and the `[data-surface='…']` scopes, then exposed through
  `@theme inline` so a utility resolves them **at the element**. That is what lets `bg-surface-page text-ink`
  work with no `dark:` prefix.
- **Semantic names, not literal ones.** `--color-primary-700`, not `--color-green-700`. The portal is
  re-pointable at another LGU by changing the ramp.
- **Prefer a `@bettergov/kapwa` component** over a bespoke one, and match its API shape when you do write one.
  Note that no Kapwa dist file carries `'use client'`, so its interactive components must be imported from
  inside one of our client leaves.
- Compose conditional classes with `cn()` (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) and variant sets with
  `class-variance-authority`. Don't hand-concatenate class strings.
- **Mobile-first, and the site must work at 320 px.** Wide content scrolls inside its own `overflow-x: auto`
  container — the page body never scrolls horizontally.
- Prose blocks use `@tailwindcss/typography`, not ad-hoc heading styles. Body text stays at a ~16px floor;
  civic information is read by people of every age.
- **Tailwind for all styling — no inline `style` attributes.** The one exception is a genuinely dynamic value
  that cannot be a token (a computed chart dimension), and it needs a comment saying why.
- **Lucide React is the only icon library.** Don't add a second one, and don't paste a raw SVG where a Lucide
  icon exists.
- **Light mode first, dark mode as an option.** The light palette is the design; dark is derived from the same
  semantic roles, never a separate set of hardcoded colours.
- `globals.css` declares `@source '../../node_modules/@bettergov/kapwa/dist'` so Tailwind scans Kapwa's
  compiled output. Removing that line silently drops Kapwa's styles from the build.

## Accessibility — a gate, not a polish pass

**WCAG 2.1 AA is the floor.** Every merged route must satisfy:

- **Semantic HTML first** — `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<button>`, `<a>`, real headings in
  order. ARIA only where semantics genuinely fall short; a correct element beats a `role`.
- **Keyboard reachable** — everything interactive is tabbable, operable with Enter/Space, and has a **visible
  focus ring**. Never `outline: none` without a replacement.
- **Labelled controls** — every input has a `<label>`; every icon-only button has an accessible name that
  reflects its state.
- **Touch targets ≥ 44 × 44 px.** Exceptions exist and are tracked in an explicit list in
  `e2e/home.a11y.spec.ts` rather than quietly dropped from the gate.
- **Contrast verified** against the `@theme` ramp — 4.5:1 body text, 3:1 large text and UI boundaries.
- **Images** carry meaningful `alt`, or `alt=""` when decorative. Charts carry a text alternative.
- **Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`**, including the hotline ticker. Note that the CSS media query
  does not govern the JS scroll API — anything calling `scrollTo({behavior})` must read `matchMedia` itself.
- Every route ships an **`@a11y`-tagged Playwright check** using `@axe-core/playwright`.

Axe catches roughly a third of real accessibility problems. Tab through the page yourself before calling a
route done.

## SEO & metadata

- **Next.js built-ins only** — `export const metadata`, or `generateMetadata` for dynamic routes.
- Every page sets a unique title, description, canonical URL, and Open Graph card. Canonicals derive from
  `config/lgu.config.json`, never a hardcoded domain.
- **`src/app/sitemap.ts` and `src/app/robots.ts` are generated from the content manifests**, so a new page
  appears in the sitemap automatically.

## Configuration & environment

- **LGU identity lives in `config/lgu.config.json`** — name, coordinates, domain, brand colour, contacts,
  socials — read through one typed, Zod-validated `src/lib/lgu-config.ts`. **Never hardcode a city name, phone
  number, coordinate, or domain in a component.**
- **Secrets live in `.env.local`** (git-ignored). `.env.example` is the committed template.
- **Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` reaches the browser — never put a secret behind that prefix.**
- No hardcoded URLs or timeouts in components.

## Security

- Treat markdown, YAML, and any URL param as **untrusted**. Validate every route and search param.
- No raw HTML passthrough, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on content. The one static theme-init script is the
  documented exception and is pinned by a unit test asserting it contains no interpolation.
- No secrets in the client bundle. **No `console.log` in committed code.**

## Naming

React components PascalCase in PascalCase files (`ServiceCard.tsx`), **functional components only**;
non-component modules kebab-case (`lgu-config.ts`); hooks `use-*.ts` exporting `useX`; route folders kebab-case
matching the URL; functions camelCase; constants SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. Types PascalCase with no `I` prefix —
cross-feature shapes in `src/types/<feature>.ts`, local shapes stay local.

## Component structure — colocation, and the three tiers

A component's _location_ encodes how widely it is used. Getting that wrong is the most common way a component
tree turns into a flat grab-bag nobody can safely delete from.

**Never place a component at the root of `components/` if only one parent uses it.** The three tiers, narrowest
first:

| Tier               | Where                                                              | Promote to it when                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sub-component**  | Inside its parent's feature folder, or a named subfolder within it | Used by exactly one parent                                                           |
| **Feature-shared** | `_shared/` inside that feature folder                              | Reused by two or more components **within the same feature**                         |
| **Global shared**  | `components/ui/`                                                   | Reused **across multiple features**, and generic enough to carry no feature coupling |

A component moves outward only when the reuse is real and present — not because it might be reused later.
`_shared/` exists precisely so feature-wide reuse doesn't force a premature promotion to `components/ui/`.

```
src/components/
  ui/                        ← global shared: Container, Section, SkipLink, BackToTop
  home/                      ← a feature
    Hero.tsx
    _shared/                 ← shared within `home` only
      SectionHeader.tsx
    stats/                   ← related sub-components, grouped
      StatBand.tsx
```

- **Group related sub-components under a named subfolder** when a parent grows more than two or three of them.
- **Keep feature-shared components decoupled from any single parent** — if it only makes sense next to one
  caller, it isn't `_shared/`, it's a sub-component.
- **Keep global shared components generic.** A component in `components/ui/` that imports from a feature, or
  names one in its props, belongs back inside that feature.
- **Avoid unnecessary deep nesting.** Folder names describe the feature or domain, not the file type.

### Modals

Live in a `modals/` subfolder inside the feature that opens them. **Omit "Modal" from the filename only** —
`modals/AddContact.tsx` — and **keep it in the exported name**:

```ts
export function AddContactModal() {}
```

```ts
import { AddContactModal } from './modals/AddContact';
```

### Route structure mirrors the same idea

**Group sub-pages under their parent route folder.** If a page is conceptually a child of another page, it
lives inside the parent's folder — the URL and the filesystem agree, and the parent's `layout.tsx` applies
without a second thought.

```
src/app/[locale]/services/page.tsx              ✅  /services
src/app/[locale]/services/[category]/page.tsx   ✅  /services/health
src/app/[locale]/services-health/page.tsx       ❌  flat, and the layout doesn't nest
```

## Machinery this portal deliberately does not have

Four things a general Next.js product would reach for are absent here on purpose. Recorded so the difference
reads as a decision rather than an oversight — **don't introduce any of them without an explicit ask.**

| Absent                                                                   | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A database / ORM** (Prisma, migrations, server components querying it) | `content/` is the data layer and `src/lib/content.ts` is the only module that reads it. A portal whose content is files in the repo is reviewable, forkable, and correctable by a non-engineer — that is the architecture, not a limitation to grow out of                  |
| **shadcn/ui**                                                            | `@bettergov/kapwa` is the component library. Prefer a Kapwa component over a bespoke one; match its API shape when you must write your own                                                                                                                                  |
| **Server Actions**, `{ success, data, error }` returns, toast errors     | The portal is public, read-only, and collects no personal data. **If an intake surface ever ships**, a Server Action is still the right mechanism — Zod-validated at the boundary, rate-limited, storing no resident personal data. It is not an excuse to add an API route |
| **API routes** for webhooks, uploads, long-running work                  | None of those surfaces exist. Route Handlers under `src/app/api/` are for what a Server Component genuinely cannot do — never to read `content/`                                                                                                                            |

### 🔴 Specs, tickets and design notes do not live in this repository

`docs/` holds guides for working **in this codebase**. It is not where a feature spec, a fix spec, a ticket, or
a design note goes — those are kept in the project workspace this repository is developed from, alongside the
other portal's, and they are **deliberately not mirrored here**. Do not create `docs/specs/`, `docs/tickets/`,
or an equivalent, and do not accept a bare instruction like _"write the spec to `docs/specs/<slug>.md`"_ at
face value: that path means the workspace's spec folder, not this one.

**The reason is enforced, not stylistic.** A spec cites tickets, sibling specs and the reference portal's
patterns, and no file in this repository may name a path outside it — anyone who cloned only this repo would
get a dead link. `src/lib/guardrails.test.ts` sweeps the checked-in docs **recursively** and fails the
build on the first outward path, so a spec filed here is either already broken or one citation away
from it.

What _does_ belong in `docs/`: this file and the civic citations under `docs/sources/` — all of them
self-contained.

## Testing

- **Vitest** + Testing Library for units — content loaders, utilities, component behaviour, and the source
  scans in `src/lib/guardrails.test.ts`.
- **Playwright** for E2E — route renders, navigation, locale switch, 404, and accessibility. `e2e/` mirrors
  routes.
- Query by role or label, not by test id.
- A test that cannot fail is worse than no test. When you add a scan or a measurement, prove it catches a
  known-bad input before you trust it.

## The quality gate

All five must pass before a commit:

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm test && npm run test:e2e
```

`next build` does **not** lint in Next.js 16, and `next lint` has been removed — linting is always its own
step. E2E needs browsers once: `npx playwright install chromium`.

**Don't run the full gate after every edit while building.** Run what the change touches:

| Situation                                               | Run                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Changed a loader, util, or component with unit coverage | `npm test -- <path-or-pattern>`    |
| Changed a route, navigation, or locale behaviour        | `npx playwright test e2e/<file>`   |
| Touched accessibility on a route                        | `npx playwright test --grep @a11y` |
| Changed types, props, or a route signature              | `npm run typecheck`                |

Scoping while building is not the same as narrowing the gate. The gate itself is never narrowed and never
`--no-verify`'d.

## Branching, commits, versioning

- **`main` is the trunk.** Cut `feature/<slug>` or `fix/<slug>` from it and open the pull request against it.
  Fast-forward before you start — `git fetch origin` → `git pull --ff-only origin main`.
- **Conventional Commits**, enforced by commitlint on a `commit-msg` hook: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`,
  `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `perf:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `style:`. Scope by area when it clarifies —
  `feat(services): …`. Content-only changes still use a code type with a content scope
  (`docs(content): add business permit renewal guide`); there is no `content:` type and commitlint will reject
  one.
- Subject ≤ 72 characters. A body only when the _why_ isn't obvious — never a file-by-file changelog.
- One feature or fix per commit. Let Husky and lint-staged run; do not skip hooks.
- **Versioning is SemVer**, with `package.json` `version` as the single source of truth (read through
  `src/lib/version.ts`, rendered in the footer):
  - **MAJOR** — the information architecture changed, or **any published URL stops resolving**.
  - **MINOR** — a new page, route, or page section ships.
  - **PATCH** — content, copy, translations, styling, accessibility, dependencies, no-op refactors.
  - One bump per completed feature or fix, in the same commit as the work. Stay on `0.x` until the portal is
    complete, not merely deployed.

## Occam's Razor

Prefer the simplest implementation that fully satisfies the requirement. When more than one approach works,
pick the one with the **fewest moving parts** — least new code, fewest new abstractions, files, or
dependencies, smallest deviation from existing patterns. Here that usually means a content change beats a code
change; a Server Component beats a Client Component; a Kapwa component beats a bespoke one; a CSS solution
beats a JS one. Avoid speculative generality.

The same razor applies to **diagnosis**: favour the explanation that makes the fewest assumptions, then
**verify before acting**. It never overrides the accessibility, security, or data-accuracy rules.
